    Travelling to Chhattisgarh is like planning a trip to ultimate bliss. The state is blessed generously by nature and you come across examples of that every few miles. Its landscape, which is dominated for the most part by dense forests, is dotted with waterfalls, caves and a rich wildlife. Located in central India, it offers its fair share of adventure, sightseeing and exploration. The state is home to many temples and some towns which trace their origin to historical times, thus fascinating tourists, historians and archaeologists constantly. To escape the sweltering heat during summers, nature has gifted it with several hill stations, each as beautiful as the other. If you prefer coming close to modernity, head towards Raipur, its capital city which boasts an impressive number of multiplexes, cafes, restaurants, malls and markets. An outing can also include a visit to its museums which introduce you to its tribal heritage, history, food habitats and other artefacts of the various tribal communities.
</p><p align="left">
One cannot gain an insight into Chhattisgarh tourism without mentioning its tribal culture, which traces its origins to ancient times. As a tourist, you will be fascinated by the numerous tribes inhabiting this region which are culturally diverse from each other. Some of the most famous of them are Gonds, Abhuj Maria, Bison Horn Maria, Halba and Dhurvaa. Among these, people belonging to the Bison Horn Maria tribe are easily distinguished by their headdress. These are designed in a way that they resemble the horns of a wild bison. Their clothing is often bright and colorful, with the use of cotton being dominant. Women wear knee length saris. Both men and women share a love for jewellery, with the most popular items being wooden bangles, metal casts and silver ghungroos. They get their source of entertainment from cock fights and tribal dances. Some of the popular dances are Karma, Sua Nacha, Pandavani, Raut Nacha, Panthi Dance and Jhirliti. You can get a glimpse of the tribal art and culture at the museums, or exploring a village.
</p><p align="left">
Among the most popular tourism places in Chhattisgarh are its waterfalls. The king of waterfalls is the Chitrakote Falls, which, due to its height and width, is also known as the “Niagara Falls of India”. Located to the west of Jagdalpur city on the Indravati river, it falls ferociously from a height of almost 100ft. You can hear it from a distance, and upon arrival, will find out that it’s nothing short of a spectacle. The other famous waterfall is the Tirathgarh Falls, which are formed when the River Kanger cascades over seven steps before landing with a ferocious drop. The best part is, you can view these falls from a close proximity. Other famous waterfalls in the state are Mendri Ghoomar, Amritdhara, Rajpuri, Chhuri, Tiger Point, Rakasganda, Devdhara, Kailash Gufa and Kendai.

    Kutumsar caves are also home to a particular species of genetically blind fish. Several of them are worshipped as Shiva lingams, as is evidenced by the markings. Visitors to the caves also notice certain reverberations which sound magical. It’s an absolute thrill to venture into the darkness and explore these amazing natural formations. Sitabhagra is another cave with mythological importance, since it is believed to have been the residence of Goddess Sita. Human footprints in one corner are as mysterious today as they were thousands of years ago. Another cave which is a major tourist attraction in Chhattisgarh, particularly for history lovers and archaeologists are the Singhanpur Caves. Situated about 20 km from Raigarh, they are home to the oldest sculptures on earth which are believed to date date back to 30,000BC.

    <p align="left">
    It is about to venture back in to the past, and get mesmerized by timeless sculptures. Certainly the land of eternity and artistic stone sculptures, Tala is located on the bank of the Maniari River near the village of Ameri Kampa. Often identified as the Sangamagrama mentioned in the records of the Panduvamshis of Mekala, Tala is situated at the confluence of Shivnath and Maniari River. Most famous for its Devrani-Jethani Temples, Tala was discovered by J.D.Welger, an assistant to the well-known archaeologist Alexander Cunningham in1873-74. Historians have claimed that the Tala village dates back to the 7-8th century AD.

    </p>
<p align="left">
Located near Tala is the Sargaon Village that boasts of the Dhoom Nath Temple. This Temple has the Shiva Smaraks of God Kirari, and Malhar is just 18kms from here. Tala is a land of precious archaeological excavations that have revealed excellent sculpture work. Archaeologists and historians are mesmerized by intricately crafted stone engravings. These exquisite excavations narrate the prosperity of Tala during the 6th to 10th century AD. However, the various excavated ruins obtained and the sculpture-style tell us the various dynasties that reigned Tala were Lord Shiva’s devotees and propagators of the Shiva religion. Perhaps, that is why, even today Shiva devotees flock to the temples here in order to perform various rituals and chant the holy Mahamrityunjay Mantra. Lord Shiva’s devotees offer their prayers here and also love to visit other excavations. Tala is also home to various temples built by the Nishad Samaj, which include the Ram-Janaki Temple, the Swami Purnanand Mahajan Temple and Gaushala.
