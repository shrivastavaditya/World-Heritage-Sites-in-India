    <h4 align="center">ROCK GARDEN</h4>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Garden_of_Chandigarh" target="_blank">
    <img src="rock.jpg" align="right" alt="">
    </a>
    <p align="left">
    Chandigarh has the distinction of having a unique world-acclaimed Rock Garden. It consists of art objects, fashioned from industrial and urban waste. It is situated between the Capitol Complex and Rock Garden of Chandigarh Sukhna Lake in Sector 1. It nestles amidst 20 acres of woods in the form of an open air exhibition hall, theatre trove and a miniature maze all rolled into one vast fantasy land of art and landscape. It is without doubt, a tourist spot that is a must on the itinerary of every visitor to Chandigarh. </p>
    <p align="left">An unpretentious entrance leads to a magnificent, almost surrealist arrangement of rocks, boulders, broken chinaware, discarded fluorescent tubes, broken and cast away glass bangles, building waste, coal and clay-all juxtaposed to create a dream folk world of palaces, soldiers, monkeys, village life, women and temples. The open air sculptures and concealed gateways separating them are at places enhanced by a waterfall, pools and an open air theatre with proper stage setting. Several prestigious performances have been staged in this small but very artistic and naturalistic open air theatre.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>History</b>
        <br>
        The Rock Garden has become almost a heritage site. Artists and connoisseurs from all over the world flock to see this unique and amazing creation. The concept is daring, the appeal perennial. Visitors leave in admiration, only to return again. The creator of the Rock Garden, Nek Chand, was a Road Inspector in the Engineering Department of Chandigarh Capital Project. He roamed the Shivalik Foothills and picked up stones resembling bird, animal, human and abstract forms. He brought them on his bicycle. The first seven years (1958-65) were spent collecting natural material, urban and industrial waste. Gradually his collection mounted to a staggering twenty thousand rock forms of amazing beauty. These were deposited around a hut which he had built for his work and contemplation. He built the Rock Garden from this improvised hut which was located by the side of a stream.On February 24, 1973, the Rock Garden was accidentally discovered by Dr. S K Sharma who headed an Anti-Malaria party during a vector reconnaissance duty in the forest in which the garden is located. Soon thereafter the late Dr. M S Randhawa ( a former Chief Commissioner of Chandigarh ) visited the place and placed the matter before the Chandigarh Landscape Advisory Committee, as its Chairman, at a meeting held on June 23, 1973, suggesting that this garden of rocks, stones and scrap was the most unusual and it should be preserved in its present form, free from the interference of architects and town planners. The Rock Garden was thus inaugurated in 1976.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Collection</b>
        <br>
        Since the site where Rock Garden stands today was also used as a dumping ground for urban and industrial waste, Nek Chand picked up pieces of foundry lime-kiln and metal workshop wastes and also shaped them with his creative genius, resembling human, animal or abstract forms. These pieces have been innovatively displayed as sculptures in the garden.Also, on display are shapes sculptured by using a variety of discarded materials such as frames, mudguards, forks, handle bars, metal wires, play marbles, crowns of soft drink bottles, porcelain, auto parts, broken bangles, pieces of slate, burnt bricks and even human hair recovered from barbers' shop.The layout of the Garden is based on the fantasy of a lost kingdom. The moment one enters the garden, the small entrance doors make the head bow, not only create an ambience of royal grandeur but also impart humbleness. One has to pass through a variety of doorways, archways, vestibules, streets and lanes of different scales and dimensions, each one opening into a new array of displays or courtyards and chambers lending an air of suspense and curiosity at every corner, at every turn !

In the true spirit of a make-believe `kingdom' the Rock Garden has fourteen different chambers, like the forecourt : housing natural rock-forms, a royal poet's and a musician's chamber complete with a pond and a hut; the main court (Durbar) where the king's throne adorns the place with natural stone forms depicting gods and goddesses lining the place; a swimming pool for the queen, etc. Another phase of the garden comprises the grand palace complex, minars, water falls, an open air theatre, a village, mountains, overbridges, pavilions and areas for royal pleasures. The tree and root sculpture offers a powerful counterpoint to the existing vegetation.An open air theatre and a vast pavilion with a centre stage are the other highlights of the Rock Garden where art and culture blend amidst the rustic and exotic environs of the garden.The Teej Festival, when the Rock Garden assumes a festive look, holds a special attraction for tourists. Young damsels partake in the fun and frolic by swaying on the giant swings, while others adorn their hands with traditional Mehandi (henna), amidst joyful songs and dances.As you stroll through the Rock Garden, enjoying the awe inspiring creation, you may find yourself face to face with the unassuming, down to earth artist Nek Chand himself, in flesh and blood, working at or supervising his 'kingdom'.

    <h4 align="center">SUKHNA LAKE</h4>
    <p align="right">
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukhna_Lake" target="_blank">
    <img src="sukhna.jpg" align="right" alt=""></a>
</p>
    <p align="left">
    The manmade picturesque Sukhna lake in the foothills of Shivalik range is an idyllic place for quiet communion with nature and for offering water sports activities such as boating, yachting, water skiing, etc. The creation of Lake was one of the greatest gift from Le Corbusier and P L Varma Chief Engineer. To preserve its tranquility Corbusier insisted that it be forbidden to motor boats and the top of the dam (promenade) prohibited to vehicular traffic. </p>
    <p align="left">Sukhna is an inseparable part of the city. Le Corbusier had foreseen that the residents of the city would be drawn it for the 'care of the body and spirit'. The planners of the city will be thrilled to find that this beautiful gift to the city has extended its attraction beyond its boundaries. The city planners were deeply attached to the lake. So much so that Pierre Jeanneret's ashes were immersed in the lake in 1970 as per his wishes by his niece.This 3 sq km rainfed lake was created in 1958 by damming the Sukhna Choe, a seasonal stream coming down from the Shivalik Hills. Originally the seasonal flow entered the lake directly causing heavy siltation. To check the inflow of silt, land measuring 2542 hectares was acquired in the catchment area and put under vegetation. In 1974, the Choe was diverted and made to bye-pass the lake completely, the lake being fed by three siltation pots, minimising the entry of silt into the lake itself.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
    The roof of the 'bund' or dam, elegantly landscaped has become a favourite promenade. Serious 'walkers' pursue an exercise regime, families enjoy an evening stroll and nature lovers mingle with children on roller skates - to partake of this extraordinary amenity. Photographers and painters love to capture its scenic beauty of the setting sun, or the heavily clouded monsoon sky, or the early morning mist in winter set amidst the tranquility of the lake. Even anglers do not leave unrewarded.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
    Sukhna is a sanctuary for many exotic migratory birds like the Siberian duck, Storks and Cranes, during the winter months. The Lake has been declared as a protected national wetland by the Government of India. People of Chandigarh love Sukhna. During summers, there are streams of men, women and children from all walks of life offering voluntary service to desilt the lake bed for about three months. This annual ritual has been a regular feature since long.Sukhna Lake is the venue for many festive celebrations too. The most popular is the Mango Festival held during the monsoons when scores of varieties of mangoes are on display. From time-to-time other food festivals, featuring specialities from different Indian States, are also held here, alongwith cultural performances.

    <h4 align="center">COMPLEX DU CAPITOLE</h4>
    <p align="right">
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandigarh_Capitol_Complex" target="_blank">
    <img src="capitol.jpg" align="right" alt=""></a>
</p>
    <p align="left">
    For Le Corbusier, Chandigarh’s Sector 1 is where the master architect unleashed his creativity, setting up the city’s most awe-inspiring landmark – The Capitol Complex.Both geographically and symbolically, the Capitol Complex occupies the compositional apex of the Chandigarh Plan. Located at the foot of the Shivalik Hills, together with the “Rajendra Park” stretching away on its western flank and Lake Sukhna to the east, it forms the Capitol Park, extending across the width of the city. </p>
    <p align="left"> When Punjab was rent asunder by the British, the Radcliffe Line awarded Lahore to western Punjab, leaving the eastern part of the (Indian) state without a capital.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
    The Capitol Complex stands out visually and physically from the rest of the city by a formal conception that embodies the dignity of the three fundamental powers – executive, legislative and judicial – of the two states of Punjab and Haryana, and of the Chandigarh administration.It is the largest monumental complex designed and built by Le Corbusier. He designed the three main buildings that make it up – the Palace of the Assembly, the Secretariat and the High Court of Justice – but also the furniture, the luminaries, the bas-reliefs moulded in the concrete, as well as works of art like the enamelled door of the Palace of the Assembly and a series of monumental tapestries. These three buildings are located on a pedestrian esplanade punctuated by other posthumous Corbusean creations: the Monument of the Open Hand, the Depth of Consideration, the Martyrs’ Memorial, the Tower of Shadows, the Geometrical Hill, as well as the reflecting pools of the High Court and the Assembly.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
    The Capitol mixes primary forms taken from Purist geometry with Brutalist expression punctuated by a polychromy of bold colours contrasting with the monochrome appearance of the raw concrete. The buildings combine European modernity – the many expressive variations of reinforced concrete – with local techniques and materials. The textures vary according to the various kinds of formwork and surface treatments. In order to preserve the authenticity of the materials, the outer surfaces were not coated but simply painted in places using Le Corbusier’s particular colour range.The composition of the site results from the desire to integrate the architecture into the landscape and the desire to reconcile man, nature and the cosmos. The human scale is connected to the monumental scale of the architecture and the public space by creating artificial earth mounds or tree and shrub plantations, and the glimpses of distant landscapes have been preserved.
