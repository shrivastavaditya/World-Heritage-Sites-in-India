Andhra Pradesh, with its exquisite temples and ancient shrines, is counted among the top pilgrimage destinations in India. On an Andhra Pradesh pilgrimage tour, tourists can visit the sacred ‘Mallikarjuna Temple’ in Srisailam and pay their obeisance to one of the 12 Jyotirlingas of Shiva, admire the architectural brilliance of the stunning mural-adorned edifice of the ‘Lepakshi Temple’ in Anantpur, or just soak in the mystical aura of the ‘Kanaka Durga Temple’ at Vijayawada, where Goddess Durga is worshipped in her Mahishasurmardini avatar.
</p><p align="left">
Apart from that, pilgrimage tourism in Andhra Pradesh should also involve a visit to the holy abode of Lord Shri Venkateswara Swamy, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu who is believed to have been residing in the hallowed sanctuary of “Tirumala Tirupati Balaji Temple” since Vedic times. Built in 300 AD by the Tamil King, Thondaimaan, it is one of the world’s richest shrines, which receives a donation of over 300 crore every year from millions and millions of devotees.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
    Andhra Pradesh, having been ruled by powerful and glorious dynasties like Mauryas, Cholas, Chalukyas, and the famous Vijayanagara Empire, is dotted with magnificent structures which reflect its rich past. For that very reason, it is regarded as one of the top tourist destinations to experience heritage tourism in India. Your heritage tour should begin with a visit to the town of Amaravathi, located in Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh. It is a treasure house of several structures and monuments dating back to the Satvahana Era. The Amaravati Stupa, Amaravati Mahachaitya and Amaralingeswara Temple are some of the best heritage places to visit in Andhra Pradesh.

    </a>
    <p align="left">
    Situated in the Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh, Tirupati is known for Lord Venkateshwara Temple, one of the most visited pilgrimage centres in the country. Tirumala is one of the seven hills in Tirupati, where the main temple is located. The temple is believed to be placed where Lord Venkateshwara took the form of an idol and is hence home to the diety Govinda. Tirupati is one of the oldest cities of India and finds mention in plenty of ancient Vedas and Puranas.</p>
    <p align="left">The non-stop chanting of ‘Om Namo Venkatesaya’, the mad pilgrim rush and the 8-feet tall idol of Lord Venkateshwara – everything about the Sri Venkateshwara Temple is majestic. Spread over an area of 26 kilometres and visited by nearly 50,000 pilgrims every day, the temple is also commonly referred to as the Temple of Seven Hills.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
    There are other temples in Tirupati too that you can visit, including the Sri Kalahasti temple, Sri Govindarajaswami Temple, the Kondandarama Temple, the Parashurameshwara Temple, and the ISKCON temple. Tirupati is home to a unique geological wonder that you shouldn’t miss out on! The Silathoranam is a natural arch formed out of rocks and is located at the Tirumala Hills.

    <img src="amra.jpg" align="right" alt=""></a>
</p>
    <p align="left">
    Known as the Capital of Andhra Pradesh, Amaravathi is a planned city on the banks of the River Krishna. Amaravathi is renowned for being a site of a Buddhist Stupa that is a semi-hemispherical structure containing Buddhist relics and often called the Abode of God. </p>
    <p align="left">Located 32 kilometres north of Guntur District, Amaravati is a prime hub of pilgrimage and sightseeing. The original structure was established during the reign of Emperor Ashoka which is now a meditation site in the city.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
    Being built on a 217km riverfront, the city is designed to have 51% of green spaces. Its foundation stone was laid on 22 October 2015 by prime Minister Narendra Modi. After the separation into two states in the year 2014, Hyderabad was declared the capital city of the then newly formed state Telangana.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
    It led to Amaravathi being chosen as the Capital of Andhra Pradesh. The word Amaravathi in itself was derived from the ancient capital of Satavahana dynasty. Pilgrims visit this town almost throughout the year owing to the number of temples and shrines that adorn the little town in different parts.

    <h4 align="center">VISAKHAPATNAM</h4>
    <p align="right">
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visakhapatnam" target="_blank">
    <img src="vish.jpg" align="right" width="600px" alt=""></a>
</p>
    <p align="left">
    Visakhapatnam, also commonly known as Vizag, is one of the oldest port cities in the country. Situated in the heart of Andhra Pradesh, Visakhapatnam is known for its picturesque beaches and serene landscape, as well as a rich cultural past. The port of Visakhapatnam is renowned for being home to the oldest shipyard in all of India. Located a short distance away from Visakhapatnam is Araku Valley, one of the prime attractions of Vizag. Situated at a lofty 910 metres above sea level, Araku Valley is a hill station replete with gushing waterfalls, crystal clear streams, lush green gardens and some challenging trekking trails. </p>
    <p align="left">Vizag is dotted with many beaches along its coastline, with the most famous one being the Yarada Beach. One of the most stunning places to see in all of Visakhapatnam, Yarada beach is surrounded by majestic hills on three sides, and by the Bay of Bengal on the other side. One of the best things about Vizag’s beaches is that they are a lot cleaner and a lot less crowded than other famous beaches along the Indian coastline, and Yarada beach is no exception. It is the perfect place to sit back on the golden sands and witness a marvellous sunrise or sunset. 
    </p>
    <p align="left">
    If you’re a history lover, the Borra Caves are one of the best tourist attractions that Vizag has to offer for you. Nestled amidst the Ananthagiri Hills in Araku Valley, the Borra Caves are over thousands of years old and are the biggest among all the caves found in India. Made entirely of natural karstic limestone, the caves are kaleidoscopic in nature, and the light falling on the rocks coupled with the waterfalls creates an extremely colourful effect, lending an aura of magic and mysticism to the entire ambience.
    </p>
    <p align="left">
    The Katiki Waterfalls, situated a short distance away from the Borra Caves, is a gushing waterfall that measures around 50 feet in height and is completely surrounded by the lush greenery of the valley. The crystal-clear water cascading down the rocks, bordered by the gleaming green foliage is a sight for sore eyes. Being a coastal area, the primary cuisine of Visakhapatnam includes seafood, as well as traditional Andhra South Indian cuisine.  While Visakhapatnam is not exactly renowned for being a shopping destination, you will still find a lot of things that you can take back home. You can purchase a wide variety of stuff starting from handicrafts to Kalamkari paintings to wooden toys to even gorgeous Pochampalli and Ikat sarees.
